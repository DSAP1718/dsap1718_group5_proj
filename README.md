# MFCC – Based Speech Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks  

**Abstract** – Speech recognition is an important role in emerging technology especially in devices which uses speech. In this project, the researchers applied MFCC which gives 26 coefficients and fed in Artificial Neural Networks.

In this paper, the proponents developed a tool that will recognize speech of each member using Artificial Neural Networks. Each member recorded a voice or speech signal using Matlab. Then, the raw data exported in a sheet. It is used to generate 26 MFCC and pre – train it in ANN. The ANN embedded in Excel and applied speech processing and recognition. The outputs are waveform of the speech signal with corresponding recognized words. In this works, it is limited to recognized 7 words/names spoken by 7 speakers.
